# Implement Community and Profile Reporting System

## Problem

Users currently have no way to report inappropriate threads, replies, or user profiles. Admins also lack a dedicated interface to review and judge these reports.

## What to Fix

1.  **Database**: Add `Report` model to `schema.prisma` with `targetType` (THREAD, REPLY, PROFILE).
2.  **Server Actions**: Implement submission and admin judging actions.
3.  **Public UI**: Add report buttons to threads, replies, and profile pages.
4.  **Admin UI**: Create a moderation panel at `/admin/reports` to judge and resolve reports.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can report content/profiles.
- Admins can view and judge reports in the dashboard.
- Resolved reports can trigger content hiding or profile flags.
