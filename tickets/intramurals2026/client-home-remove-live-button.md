## Problem

The "Live" badge/button in the frontend is no longer required and should be removed for a cleaner UI.

## What to Fix

2.  **Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary live count fetching from the home page component.

## Acceptance Criteria

- "Live" badge is no longer visible in the hero section.
- UI layout remains intact.
